## Project Objectives:
- Evaluate the historical hitting performance of MLB's top players during the three years from 2021 to 2023.
- Identify trends and patterns in the historical performance data to understand how player-hitting performance has evolved over the specified period.
- Forecast the hitting performance of top MLB players for the 2024 season to enhance coaching strategies and player contribution.

## Project Deliverables
From the analysis of Evaluating MLB's Top Player Hitting Performance and Predicting Future Performance, I intend to:

- Provide prediction of the future performance of a given player.
- Provide actionable insights into the player's contributions to his team.

## Project Scope
- The data to be analysed focuses specifically on the hitting performance of MLB's top players over three years from 2021 to 2023 examine the performance of these players, dissecting every swing, very hit, and every at-bat, incorporating time series analysis and linear regression for prediction.
- The player performance analysis will be made of the top players using MLB players ranking during the period.
- The project depends on the availability of quality historical data for MLB players.
- Forecast prediction will be limited to 1 year to maintain accuracy.
