**Data Cleaning & Analysis** - Excel

**Data Tranformation & Data Visualization** - PowerBI

## Research Question
Evaluating MLB Top Player Hitting Performance and Predicting Future Performance Using Time Series Analysis and Linear Regression from 2021 - 2023.

## Project Objectives:
- Evaluate the historical hitting performance of MLB's top players during the three years from 2021 to 2023.
- Identify trends and patterns in the historical performance data to understand how player-hitting performance has evolved over the specified period.
- Forecast the hitting performance of top MLB players for the 2024 season to enhance coaching strategies and player contribution.

## Project Deliverables
From the analysis of Evaluating MLB's Top Player Hitting Performance and Predicting Future Performance, I intend to:

- Compare key performances among certain specific players.
- Identify game-by-game trends and patterns in hitting performance.
- Provide prediction of the future performance of a given player.
- Provide actionable insights into the player's contributions to his team.

## Project Scope
- The data to be analysed focuses specifically on the hitting performance of MLB's top players over three years from 2021 to 2023 examine the performance of these players, dissecting every swing, very hit, and every at-bat, incorporating time series analysis and linear regression for prediction.
- The player performance analysis will be made of the top players using MLB players ranking during the period.
- The project depends on the availability of quality historical data for MLB players.
- Forecast prediction will be limited to 1 year to maintain accuracy.

## Summary of Findings
The Power BI visuals employed in the analysis serve as dynamic tools to distil complex hitting performance data into visually comprehensible insights. These visuals are instrumental in presenting temporal patterns, trends, and predictive outcomes related to key metrics such as On-Base Percentage (OBP), Batting Average (AVG), and Slugging Percentage (SLG). The interactive and intuitive nature of Power BI visuals facilitates a holistic understanding of the temporal dynamics of player-hitting performance, allowing stakeholders to explore relationships, uncover patterns, and gain actionable insights. From time series plots and decomposition charts to predictive forecasting models, these visuals provide a comprehensive and accessible overview of the data, enhancing the interpretability and applicability of the analytical findings.
In this analysis, a set of visualizations has been deployed. These encompass time series plots like line charts, illustrating temporal patterns of key metrics such as On-Base Percentage (OBP), Batting Average (AVG), and Slugging Percentage (SLG), provide insights into underlying components, while correlation matrices visually showcase relationships between hitting performance variables. Predictive forecasting models represented through line charts with overlaid predictions, offer a glimpse into future trends. Power BI dashboards, as interactive platforms, integrate various visualizations for dynamic exploration. Tables, scatter plots, and data points provide granular information on player performances.
Time series plots, including line charts and area charts, visually showcase the performance trends of key metrics (OBP, AVG, SLG) over the specified period (2021-2023). Peaks and troughs in these charts offer insights into seasonal variations and long-term performance trends of MLB's top players.
Correlation plots, reveal the strength and direction of relationships between hitting performance variables. Positive correlations suggest that as one metric increases, the other tends to increase, while negative correlations indicate an inverse relationship.

## Limitations
- Hitting performance can be influenced by various individual factors such as injuries, changes in playing style, and personal circumstances. These factors might not be fully captured in the dataset, potentially leading to incomplete models.
- External factors such as changes in management, coaching staff, or league rules can impact player performance. These external variables might not be included in the analysis, affecting the model's ability to make accurate predictions.
